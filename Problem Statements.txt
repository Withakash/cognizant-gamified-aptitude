Problem Statement

Alice likes collecting soft toys. Every day, she adds one soft toy to her collection more than she did the day before.

She adds 1 soft toy on the first day,

2 soft toys on the second day,

3 on the third day, and so on.

She finds a day special if the total number of soft toys she has collected up to that day is divisible by 5.

You are given an integer N, representing the total number of days.
Your task is to find and return the count of special days between 1 and N (both inclusive).

Input Specification

input1: An integer N, representing the number of days for which Alice collects soft toys.

Output Specification

Return an integer value representing the count of special days between 1 and N (both inclusive).

Example 1
Input:
6

Working:

Day-wise total soft toys:

Day 1 → 1 → not divisible by 5

Day 2 → 1+2 = 3 → not divisible by 5

Day 3 → 1+2+3 = 6 → not divisible by 5

Day 4 → 1+2+3+4 = 10 → divisible by 5

Day 5 → 1+2+3+4+5 = 15 → divisible by 5

Day 6 → 21 → not divisible by 5

Special days = 4, 5 → count = 2

Output:
2

Example 2
Input:
10

Output:
4
